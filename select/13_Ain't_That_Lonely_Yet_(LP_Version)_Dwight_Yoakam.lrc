[00:09.53] You keep calling me on the telephone
[00:15.89] You say you're all alone, well that's real sad
[00:24.98] And you keep leavin' notes stuck on my door
[00:31.10] Guess you're hungry for some more, girl that's too bad
[00:58.10] 
[00:39.80] Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
[00:48.97] After what you put me through
[00:53.23] Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
[01:06.73] 
[01:07.86] Once there was this spider in my bed
[01:13.63] I got caught up in her web, of love and lies
[01:23.65] She spun her chains around my heart and soul
[01:29.65] Never to let go, oh but I survived
[01:46.65] 
[01:38.48] Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
[01:47.27] After what you put me through
[01:51.26] Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
[01:56.98] Nothing left you can do to try and bring me 'round
[02:21.98] 
[02:05.66] Cause everything you do, brings me down, wo-oh
[02:13.73] And I, ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
[02:23.12] After what you put me through
[02:27.15] Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
[02:40.65] 
[02:32.24] Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
[02:41.18] After what you put me through
[02:45.46] Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
[02:50.19] Cause I ain't that lonely yet, no I ain't that lonely yet
[02:59.03] After what you put me through
[03:02.78] Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
